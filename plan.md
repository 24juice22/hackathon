# Plan for Chrome Extension

- How do you access tabs?
- Could we manipulate them?

- personalization of your Chrome window
- we connect our functionality to Chrome in manifest.json
- could also make it do something for specific sites, e.g. Facebook - limit your time on there.

- Do we want to customize sites

## Ideas

### Tab consolidator
- Tab closer and recorder - closes all other tabs that open besides current, records URLs of those closed tabs

### Tab waterfall
- Helps you see the tabs you have open when you get past too many.  Increase tab size, but make them spill over
